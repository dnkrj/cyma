    <h2>Cymatic Projections</h2>
    <p>
      Audio is becoming increasingly prominent in how we interact with technology. AI driven voice assistants such as Google Assistant or Alexa are cited as the future of human computer interaction. To accompany these audio driven experiences a variety of visuals are used, from Google Home's four LEDS, Amazon Home's LED ring and the HomePod glowing top display.
      <br><br>
      These LEDs and displays lack expression and are deeply limited to the device in which they are built. In this project and performance the use of a cymatic projector is explored to create a more expressive audio visualisation that integrates better into the environment it is in.
      <br><br>
      Cymatics are patterns formed on the surface of a vibrating liquid. By projecting and focusing light through this liquid, the patterns can be displayed as an image on a two dimensional surface.
      <br><br>
      In the performance (live or prerecorded) a cymatic projector built by the performer will be used to display a variety of patterns in response to live and played-back audio showcasing the potential of more advanced audio visualisations in the accompaniment of AI voice assistants and more broadly in musical performances.
